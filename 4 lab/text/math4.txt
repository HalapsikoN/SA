use the integrand f(z) = 1/(z
2 + 6z + 8) together with the idea of the last
example, then there is no “auxiliary radius” that helps. More precisely,
((reiθ)
2 + 6reiθ + 8) is a constant multiple of r
2 + 6r + 8 only if θ is an
integer multiple of 2π. The following non-obvious device is often of great
utility in problems of this kind. Define log z on U ≡ C \ {x : x ≥ 0} by
log(reiθ) = (log r) + iθ when 0 < θ < 2π, r > 0. Here log r is understood to
be the standard real logarithm. Then, on U, log is a well-defined holomorphic
function. [Observe here that there are infinitely many ways to define the
logarithm function on U. One could set log(reiθ) = (log r) + i(θ + 2kπ)
for any integer choice of k. What we have done here is called “choosing a
branch” of the logarithm.]
We use the contour ηR displayed in Figure 4.11 and integrate the function
g(z) = log z/(z
2 + 6z + 8). Let

4.6.1 Meromorphic Functions
We have considered carefully those functions that are holomorphic on sets
of the form D(P, r) \ {P} or, more generally, of the form U \ {P}, where U
is an open set in C and P ∈ U. As we have seen in our discussion of the
calculus of residues, sometimes it is important to consider the possibility that
80 Chapter 4. Isolated Singularities
a function could be “singular” at more than just one point. The appropriate,
precise definition requires a little preliminary consideration of what kinds of
sets might be appropriate as “sets of singularities.”
4.6.2 Definition of Meromorphic Function
Now fix an open set U; we next define the central concept of meromorphic
function on U.
A meromorphic function f on U with singular set S is a function f :
U \ S → C such that
(4.6.3.1) S is discrete;
(4.6.3.2) f is holomorphic on U \ S (note that U \ S is necessarily open in
C);
(4.6.3.3) for each P ∈ S and r > 0 such that D(P, r) ⊆ U and S∩D(P, r) =
{P}, the function f


D(P,r)\{P}
has a (finite order) pole at P.
For convenience, one often suppresses explicit consideration of the set S
and just says that f is a meromorphic function on U. Sometimes we say,
informally, that a meromorphic function on U is a function on U that is
holomorphic “except for poles.” Implicit in this description is the idea that
a pole is an “isolated singularity.” In other words, a point P is a pole of f if
and only if there is a disc D(P, r) around P such that f is holomorphic on
D(P, r) \ {P} and has a pole at P. Back on the level of precise language,
we see that our definition of a meromorphic function on U implies that, for
each P ∈ U, either there is a disc D(P, r) ⊆ U such that f is holomorphic
on D(P, r) or there is a disc D(P, r) ⊆ U such that f is holomorphic on
D(P, r) \ {P} and has a pole at P.
4.6.3 Examples of Meromorphic Functions
Meromorphic functions are very natural objects to consider, primarily because they result from considering the (algebraic) reciprocals—or more generally the quotients—of holomorphic functions:
If U is a connected, open set in C and if f : U → C is a holomorphic
function having at least some zeros but with f 6≡ 0, then the function
F : U \ {z : f(z) = 0} → C (4.6.4.1)
4.6. SINGULARITIES AT INFINITY 81
defined by F(z) = 1/f(z) is a meromorphic function on U with singular set
(or pole set) equal to {z ∈ U : f(z) = 0}. More generally, meromorphic
functions locally have the form g(z)/f(z) for f, g holomorphic. In a sense
that can be made precise, all meromorphic functions arise as quotients of
holomorphic functions.
4.6.4 Meromorphic Functions with Infinitely Many Poles
It is quite possible for a meromorphic function on an open set U to have
infinitely many poles in U. The function 1/ sin(1/z) is an obvious example
on U = D \ {0}.
4.6.5 Singularities at Infinity
Our discussion so far of singularities of holomorphic functions can be generalized to include the limit behavior of holomorphic functions as |z| → +∞.
This is a powerful method with many important consequences. Suppose for
example that f : C → C is an entire function. We can associate to f a
new function G : C \ {0} → C by setting G(z) = f(1/z). The behavior
of the function G near 0 reflects, in an obvious sense, the behavior of f as
|z| → +∞. For instance
lim
|z|→+∞
|f(z)| = +∞ (4.6.6.1)
if and only if G has a pole at 0.
Suppose that f : U → C is a holomorphic function on an open set U ⊆ C
and that, for some R > 0, U ⊇ {z : |z| > R}. Define G : {z : 0 < |z| <
1/R} → C by G(z) = f(1/z). Then we say that
(4.6.6.2) f has a removable singularity at ∞ if G has a removable singularity
at 0.
(4.6.6.3) f has a pole at ∞ if G has a pole at 0.
(4.6.6.4) f has an essential singularity at ∞ if G has an essential singularity
at 0.
82 Chapter 4. Isolated Singularities
4.6.6 The Laurent Expansion at Infinity
The Laurent expansion of G around 0, G(z) = P+∞

, yields immediately
a series expansion for f which converges for |z| > R, namely,

. (4.6.7.1)
The series P+∞
−∞ a−nz

is called the Laurent expansion of f around ∞.
It follows from our definitions and from our earlier discussions that f has a
removable singularity at ∞ if and only if the Laurent series of f at ∞ has
no positive powers of z with non-zero coefficients. Also f has a pole at ∞ if
and only if the series has only a finite number of positive powers of z with
non-zero coefficients. Finally, f has an essential singularity at ∞ if and only
if the series has infinitely many positive powers.
4.6.7 Meromorphic at Infinity
Suppose that f : C → C is an entire function. Then lim|z|→+∞ |f(z)| = +∞ if
and only if f is a nonconstant polynomial. In other words, an entire function
that is not a polynomial will have an essential singularity at infinity.
To see this last assertion, supposed that f has a pole of order k at ∞.
Subtracting a polynomial p from f if necessary, we may arrange that f − p
vanishes to order k at the origin. Of course p has degree at most k. Then
the function
g(z) = f(z) − p(z)
z
k
is entire and is bounded. By Liouville’s theorem, g is constant. But then it
follows that f is a polynomial.
The entire function f has a removable singularity at ∞ if and only if f
is a constant. This claim if obvious because f will be bounded.
Suppose that f is a meromorphic function defined on an open set U ⊆ C
such that, for some R > 0, we have U ⊇ {z : |z| > R}. We say that f
is meromorphic at ∞ if the function G(z) ≡ f(1/z) is meromorphic in the
usual sense on {z : |z| < 1/R}.
4.6. SINGULARITIES AT INFINITY 83
4.6.8 Meromorphic Functions in the Extended
Plane
The definition of “meromorphic at ∞” as given is equivalent to requiring
that, for some R0 > R, f has no poles in {z ∈ C : R0 < |z| < ∞} and that
f has a pole at ∞. The point is that a pole should not be an accumulation
point of other poles.
A meromorphic function f on C which is also meromorphic at ∞ must
be a rational function (that is, a quotient of polynomials in z). For we can
arrange for one of the poles to be at ∞. Multiplying f by a polynomial p, we
may arrange for p · f to have no poles. So it must be a polynomial. It follows
that f is a quotient of polynomials. Conversely, every rational function is
meromorphic on C and at ∞.
Remark: It is conventional to rephrase the ideas just presented by saying
that the only functions that are meromorphic in the “extended plane” are
rational functions. We will say more about the extended plane in §§6.3.1–
6.3.3.

The Argument Principle
5.1 Counting Zeros and Poles
5.1.1 Local Geometric Behavior of a Holomorphic
Function
In this chapter, we shall be concerned with questions that have a geometric,
qualitative nature rather than an analytical, quantitative one. These questions center around the issue of the local geometric behavior of a holomorphic
function.
5.1.2 Locating the Zeros of a Holomorphic Function
Suppose that f : U → C is a holomorphic function on a connected, open set
U ⊆ C and that D(P, r) ⊆ U. We know from the Cauchy integral formula
that the values of f on D(P, r) are completely determined by the values of f
on ∂D(P, r). In particular, the number and even the location of the zeros of f
in D(P, r) are determined in principle by f on ∂D(P, r). But it is nonetheless
a pleasant surprise that there is a simple formula for the number of zeros of
f in D(P, r) in terms of f (and f
0
) on ∂D(P, r). In order to obtain a precise
formula, we shall have to agree to count zeros according to multiplicity (see
§§3.1.4). We now explain the precise idea.
Let f : U → C be holomorphic as before, and assume that f has some
zeros in U but that f is not identically zero. Fix z0 ∈ U such that f(z0) = 0.
Since the zeros of f are isolated, there is an r > 0 such that D(z0, r) ⊆ U
and such that f does not vanish on D(z0, r) \ {z0}.
85
86 CHAPTER 5. THE ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE
Now the power series expansion of f about z0 has a first non-zero term
determined by the least positive integer n such that f
(n)
(z0) 6= 0. (Note that
n ≥ 1 since f(z0) = 0 by hypothesis.) Thus the power series expansion of f
about z0 begins with the n
th term:
f(z) = X∞
j=n
1
j!
∂
jf
∂zj
(z0)(z − z0)
j
. (5.1.2.1)
Under these circumstances we say that f has a zero of order n (or multiplicity
n) at z0. When n = 1, then we also say that z0 is a simple zero of f.
5.1.3 Zero of Order n
The concept of zero of “order n,” or “multiplicity n,” for a function f is so
important that a variety of terminology has grown up around it (see also
§§3.1.4). It has already been noted that, when the multiplicity n = 1, then
the zero is sometimes called simple. For arbitrary n, we sometimes say that
“n is the order of z0 as a zero of f.” More generally if f(z0) = β so that, for
some n ≥ 1, the function f(·) − β has a zero of order n at z0, then we say
either that “f assumes the value β at z0 to order n” or that “the order of
the value β at z0 is n.” When n > 1, then we call z0 a multiple point (and β
a multiple value) of the function f.
The next result provides a method for computing the multiplicity n of
the zero at z0 from the values of f, f0 on the boundary of a disc centered at
z0.
5.1.4 Counting the Zeros of a Holomorphic Function
If f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of a disc D(P, r) and has a zero of
order n at P and no other zeros in the closed disc, then

More generally, we consider the case that f has several zeros—with different locations and different multiplicities—inside a disc: Suppose that
f : U → C is holomorphic on an open set U ⊆ C and that D(P, r) ⊆ U.
Suppose that f is non-vanishing on ∂D(P, r) and that z1, z2, . . ., zk are the

Refer to Figure 5.1 for illustrations of both these situations.
The reasons for these formulas is actually quite simple. The primordial
situation is when P = 0 and f(z) = z
k
. In that case we may compute the
integral (5.1.4.1) directly and the result is immediate. We may write a more
general f as f(z) = fe(z)·z
k and then the integral (5.1.4.1) reduces, by simple
algebra, to the simpler situation just treated. Of course the integral over a
more general curve can be reduced to the integral over the boundary of a disc
by our usual device of deformation of curves. Finally, the situation of several
different zeros may be reduced to the situation of one zero by breaking up
the curve of integration into smaller curves, each having just one zero in its
interior.
5.1.5 The Argument Principle
This last formula (5.1.4.2), which is often called the argument principle, is
both useful and important. For one thing, there is no obvious reason why
88 CHAPTER 5. THE ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE

the integral in the formula should be an integer, much less the crucial integer
that it is. Since it is an integer, it is a counting function; and we need to
learn more about it.

as you can check by direct calculation. The expression on the right is just
the index of the curve γ with respect to 0 (with the notion of index that
we defined earlier—§§4.4.4). See Figure 5.2. Thus the number of zeros of
f (counting multiplicity) inside the circle {ζ : |ζ − P| = r} is equal to the
index of γ with respect to the origin. This, intuitively speaking, is equal to
the number of times that the f-image of the boundary circle winds around
0 in C.
The argument principle can be extended to yield information about meromorphic functions, too. We can see that there is hope for this notion by
investigating the analog of the argument principle for a pole.

Just as we argued for zeros, the verification of (5.1.6.1) can be reduced to
checking the identity for the function f(z) = z
−k when Q = 0.
5.1.7 The Argument Principle for Meromorphic Functions
Just as with the argument principle for holomorphic functions, this new argument principle gives a counting principle for zeros and poles of meromorphic
functions:
Suppose that f is a meromorphic function on an open set U ⊆ C, that
D(P, r) ⊆ U, and that f has neither poles nor zeros on ∂D(P, r). Assume
that n1, n2, . . . , np are the multiplicities of the zeros z1, z2, . . ., zp of f in
D(P, r) and m1, m2, . . . , mq are the orders of the poles w1, w2, . . ., wq of f in
D(P, r).

5.2 The Local Geometry of Holomorphic Functions
5.2.1 The Open Mapping Theorem
The argument principle for holomorphic functions has a consequence that is
one of the most important facts about holomorphic functions considered as
geometric mappings:
Theorem: If f : U → C is a non-constant holomorphic function
on a connected open set U, then f(U) is an open set in C.
90 CHAPTER 5. THE ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE
Figure 5.3: The open mapping principle.
(5.2.1.1)
See Figure 5.3. The result says, in particular, that if U ⊆ C is connected
and open and if f : U → C is holomorphic, then either f(U) is a connected
open set (the non-constant case) or f(U) is a single point.
To see why the open mapping principle is true, let β be a value of the
holomorphic function f. Say that f(b) = β, and let D(b, r) be a small disc
as usual in the domain of f. Suppose for simplicity that β is a simple value
of f. Then of course
1 = 1
2πi I
∂D(b,r)
f

(ζ)
f(ζ) − β
dζ . (5.2.1.2)
If we perturb β a little bit on the righthand side of this integral (a perturbation much smaller than r), then the integral will still be integer-valued, and
its value will be very close to 1. So in fact it must be 1. Thus we conclude
that f also takes on that small perturbed value of β. We have argued then
that f assumes all values near β. But this means that the image of f is open.
In the subject of topology, a function f is defined to be continuous if the
inverse image of any open set under f is also open. In contexts where the
 − δ definition makes sense, the  − δ definition (§§2.2.1, 2.2.2) is equivalent
to the inverse-image-of-open-sets definition. By contrast, functions for which
the direct image of any open set is open are called “open mappings.”
Here is a quantitative, or counting, statement that comes from the proof
of the open mapping principle: Suppose that f : U → C is a non-constant
5.3. Further Results on Zeros 91
holomorphic function on a connected open set U such that P ∈ U and
f(P) = Q with order k. Then there are numbers δ,  > 0 such that each
q ∈ D(Q, ) \ {Q} has exactly k distinct pre-images in D(P, δ) and each
pre-image is a simple point of f. Of course the justification is again a simple
application of (5.2.1.2).
The considerations that establish the open mapping principle can also
be used to establish the fact that if f : U → V is a one-to-one
